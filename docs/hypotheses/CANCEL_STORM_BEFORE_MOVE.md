# CANCEL_STORM_BEFORE_MOVE — hypothesis spec

display: Cancel storm before move

## 1. Market mechanism
Quote machines cancel en masse when their models detect imminent repricing — they will not be run over holding stale quotes (adverse-selection avoidance is their binding constraint). The cancel storm reveals the informed side before the price move completes. We trade in the direction the book slope points as the storm hits, co-riding MM anticipation, paid by whoever still crosses into the emptying side.

## 2. Signal formula
```
storm    = 1 - exp(-max(0, cancel_to_add_ratio - 1.5))
pressure = tanh(2*near_touch_cancel_pressure)
signal   = storm * pressure * tanh(2*book_slope)                # modules.py:595-603
```
- Slots: `cancel_to_add_ratio`, `near_touch_cancel_pressure`, `book_slope`.
- Range (-1,1); positive = BUY.

## 3. Falsifiable prediction
Pre-registered (mechanical, HORIZON_MAP_PREREGISTERED.json):

```
E[ mid(t + H) - mid(t) | signal(t) > s ] > hurdle
H = 15000 ms, s = 0.1
```

Directional claim: cancel storms aligned with book slope precede mid movement in the slope direction over 15s. REFUTED if the spread-adjusted conditional expectancy E[sign(signal)*(mid(t+H)-mid(t)) - taker spread cost | |signal|>s] fails to exceed the section-4 hurdle on Confirmation years (2021-2022) at BH-corrected q=0.10 over >=40 events (errors two-way clustered by event x calendar month).

## 4. Cost hurdle (authoritative: instrument_specs.py + fee_model.py, non-member tier)

| symbol | fee/side $ | multiplier | fee hurdle (pts) | fee hurdle (ticks) | + 1 tick taker slippage (ticks RT) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ES | 1.52 | 50 | 0.0608 | 0.243 | 1.243 |
| M2K | 0.52 | 5 | 0.2080 | 2.080 | 3.080 |
| MES | 0.52 | 5 | 0.2080 | 0.832 | 1.832 |
| MNQ | 0.52 | 2 | 0.5200 | 2.080 | 3.080 |
| MYM | 0.52 | 0.5 | 2.0800 | 2.080 | 3.080 |
| NQ | 1.52 | 20 | 0.1520 | 0.608 | 1.608 |
| RTY | 1.52 | 50 | 0.0608 | 0.608 | 1.608 |
| YM | 1.52 | 5 | 0.6080 | 0.608 | 1.608 |

Excluded from this model's universe (removed 2026-07-04): CL, MCL, NG, GC, MGC, SI, HG — no authoritative instrument_specs/fee rows (fail-closed per PR #57) and no lake data in this program.

Predicted edge at H must exceed the traded symbol's total hurdle or the model is
rejected at intake (template section 4).

## 5. Classification and instrument binding
- Class: offensive (catalog role: None; blocks_trade: False)
- Target universe: (none declared — no target constraint; trades any valid-universe symbol)
- Valid universe: ['ES', 'MES', 'NQ', 'MNQ', 'YM', 'MYM', 'RTY', 'M2K', 'ZN', 'ZB', 'ZF', 'ZT']
- Required leaders: none | Required sensors: none
- max_round_trips intent: single-shot event trade (v1 evidence: multi-trip machinery mostly idle)

## Evidence ledger
Pass A (expression v1, flattened semantics): rows=891, net=1380.28, realized=-520.9, win_rate_filled=0.0141. Old-semantics/v1-expression evidence — NOT model-worth evidence.
