# ABSORPTION_FADE — hypothesis spec

status: draft-complete
slug: ABSORPTION_FADE
kind: hypothesis | hyp_id: 12 | legacy: HYP_12
class: `AbsorptionFade` (packages/features_engine/src/hypotheses/modules.py:335)
execution_role: primary_alpha
display: Absorption fade

## 1. Market mechanism
A large passive player (institutional accumulator) absorbs one-sided aggressor flow at a level without letting price move — their constraint is size: they must buy from panicked or momentum sellers where liquidity exists. Once the aggressors exhaust against absorption, price moves the absorber's way. We fade the absorbed flow, paid by the aggressors' failure and the absorber's subsequent markup.

## 2. Signal formula
```
signal = -tanh(2*agg_imb) * tanh(3*absorption_score)            # modules.py:342-348
```
- Slots: `aggressor_volume_imbalance`, `absorption_score`.
- Range (-1,1); positive = BUY (sell flow being absorbed).

## 3. Falsifiable prediction
Pre-registered (mechanical, HORIZON_MAP_PREREGISTERED.json):

```
E[ mid(t + H) - mid(t) | signal(t) > s ] > hurdle
H = 15000 ms, s = 0.1
```

Directional claim: high absorption against one-sided flow predicts reversion against the flow over 15s. REFUTED if the spread-adjusted conditional expectancy E[sign(signal)*(mid(t+H)-mid(t)) - taker spread cost | |signal|>s] fails to exceed the section-4 hurdle on Confirmation years (2021-2022) at BH-corrected q=0.10 over >=40 events (errors two-way clustered by event x calendar month).

## 4. Cost hurdle (authoritative: instrument_specs.py + fee_model.py, non-member tier)

| symbol | fee/side $ | multiplier | fee hurdle (pts) | fee hurdle (ticks) | + 1 tick taker slippage (ticks RT) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ES | 1.52 | 50 | 0.0608 | 0.243 | 1.243 |
| M2K | 0.52 | 5 | 0.2080 | 2.080 | 3.080 |
| MES | 0.52 | 5 | 0.2080 | 0.832 | 1.832 |
| MNQ | 0.52 | 2 | 0.5200 | 2.080 | 3.080 |
| MYM | 0.52 | 0.5 | 2.0800 | 2.080 | 3.080 |
| NQ | 1.52 | 20 | 0.1520 | 0.608 | 1.608 |

Symbols in the declared universe WITHOUT an authoritative spec/fee row (CL, GC, HG, MCL, MGC, NG, SI) are fail-closed: NOT tradable and rejected at intake until instrument_specs.py/fee_model.py gain their rows (no lake data exists for them in this program either).

Predicted edge at H must exceed the traded symbol's total hurdle or the model is
rejected at intake (template section 4).

## 5. Classification and instrument binding
- Class: offensive (catalog role: None; blocks_trade: False)
- Target universe: (none declared — no target constraint; trades any valid-universe symbol)
- Valid universe: ['ES', 'MES', 'NQ', 'MNQ', 'YM', 'MYM', 'RTY', 'M2K', 'CL', 'MCL', 'NG', 'GC', 'MGC', 'SI', 'HG', 'ZN', 'ZB', 'ZF', 'ZT']
- Required leaders: none | Required sensors: none
- max_round_trips intent: single-shot event trade (v1 evidence: multi-trip machinery mostly idle)

## Evidence ledger
Pass A (expression v1, flattened semantics): rows=9053, net=-16224.21, realized=-19704.86, win_rate_filled=0.3085. Old-semantics/v1-expression evidence — NOT model-worth evidence.
